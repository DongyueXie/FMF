## Introduction

The segmentation task involves finding segment boundaries while simultaneously assigning labels to the segments. One partitions the genome into nonoverlapping contiguous segments, assigning one of a finite set of labels (such as 'promoter' or 'enhancer') to each, such that regions sharing the same segment label have in common certain properties in observed data.
